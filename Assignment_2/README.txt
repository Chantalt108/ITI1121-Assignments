Description: 
For part 1 of this assignment, the classes randomly draw from a set of 365
and stop when an element is drawn twice, recording the average, minimum, maximum, and mean
given the increment of increase, the set size, and the number of experiments. 

Part 2 sets a default for the parameters in part 1 and graphs the function.
